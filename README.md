# Game-Development-Course-Final-Project
The final project made for the Game Development 4490 course. Was given a base framework for OpenGL and modified/expanded on it to make a small game engine. 

Has menus, game states and player animation states, animation with sprite sheets, collision between player and platforms, 
and basic movement including a jump with a max height. 

Jump can be a small hop if pressed quickly or a high jump if held down.

This project also contains a Makefile.
